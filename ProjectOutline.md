### App Introduction & User Experience

For the Group Meal Planner and Expense Tracker app, the user experience should be intuitive and engaging from the start. Here are some layout ideas for the app introduction phase that the engineer can develop in Figma:

1. **Welcome Screen:**

   - Features a clean and inviting design with the app logo and name prominently displayed.
   - Includes a brief tagline or sentence summarizing the app's purpose.
   - "Get Started" button leading to the registration or login page.

   - A series of 3-4 slides briefly introducing the key features: Meal Planning, Grocery List Collaboration, and Expense Tracking & Splitting.
   - Each slide uses minimal text and illustrative icons or images to convey the app's benefits.
   - "Skip" and "Next" options for users to navigate through or bypass the onboarding process.

3. **Registration/Login Page:**

   - Simple and clear form fields for new users to sign up or existing users to log in.
   - Options to register or sign in using email or social media accounts for convenience.
   - Link to privacy policy and terms of use.

4. **Main Dashboard:**
   - Overview of the upcoming meals for the week with a calendar view option.
   - Quick access buttons for adding a new meal, viewing the grocery list, and checking expense summaries.
   - Notifications or alerts section for new messages, upcoming tasks, or unsettled expenses.
